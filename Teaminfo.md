## Project Summary
With **HelloWorld**, we aim to equip travelers with all they need to know to visit their dream country and communicate effortlessly. Learning a language can be quite time-consuming and challenging, especially if it is self-paced and users are not self-motivated. With HelloWorld, we target travelers who might be more interested in being able to sustain themselves in a foreign country rather than mastering a language entirely. By offering a selection of popular languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, and Portuguese, HelloWorld empowers users to choose the languages that best suit their travel plans. Along with that, users also have the opportunity to personalize their learning experience and set a target for their expected learning time, allowing them to further optimize their learning experience with our priority ranking system. With HelloWorld, we embrace the attitude of doing the bare minimum to achieve targets and enable travelers to maximize their experience of new cultures.
